changes:
  - rscadd: Roaches will now eat human, spider and roach corpses, leaving only gibs,
      bones, inventory and prosthetics organs.
  - rscadd: Fed roaches will now lay roach eggs. Roach eggs grow into roachlings which
      grow into a random adult roach. If a roachling eats a corpse it evolves into
      a fuhrer.
  - tweak: Roaches and spiders now have green-brown blood and gibs
