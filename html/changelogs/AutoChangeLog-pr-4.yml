changes:
  - code_imp: Auto-CL now looks for codeblocks annotated with "changelog" instead
      of emoji.
  - rscadd: Add the autodoc machinery
  - tweak: Limited creature candidates for the infestation event (now it's just mice,
      spiders, bats, spiders, and slimes)
  - balance: Disabled "spacevine" event
  - balance: Disabled "wallrot" event
  - balance: Lowered "grid_check" event weight lowered the maximum failure time from
      1600 seconds down to 800 seconds for APCs. SMES' failure times are lot lower.
